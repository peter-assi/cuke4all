integrationtest/ - A rails project setup to test the petclinic web app

Prerequisites:
- Ruby (best installed with RVM http://rvm.beginrescueend.com)
- rails and bundler gems (gem install bundler rails)
- Java (go ask Oracle)
- Maven

To get petclinic running you need to create a database
# mysql -u root
create database petclinic;

If your root user have a password or if you use another login you need to edit the files
- petclinic/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/database.properties
- integrationtest/config/database.yml

The Java server can be started by typing
# cd petclinic
# mvn tomcat:run

The test can be run by typing
# cd integrationtest
# rake cucumber

If you want to use a headless browser edit integrationtest/features/support/env.rb and comment out the line with :selenium and uncomment the line with :akephalos
